# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose

As part of our work at PyBer, a Python-based ride-share service, we have been tasked with creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type using provided large datasets (CSV files). We need to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type and a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

### Resources
- city_data.csv
- ride_data.csv

### Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Results

Here are the results of our analysis:

As can been seen by the chart above:

- Urban cities have the most rides, followed by suburban and then rural cities.
- Urban cities have the most drivers, followed by suburban and then rural cities.
- Urban cities have the highest total of fares, followed by suburban and then rural cities.
- Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride, followed by suburban and then urban cities.
- Rural cities have the highest average fare per driver, followed by suburban and then urban cities.
