# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose

As part of our work at PyBer, a Python-based ride-share service, we have been tasked with creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type using provided large datasets (CSV files). We need to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type and a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

### Resources
- city_data.csv
